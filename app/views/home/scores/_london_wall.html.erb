<h2>Within the Historical London Wall</h2>

<p>This location falls within the approximate boundary of the medieval City of London wall. The wall was built by the Romans around 200 AD and defined the boundaries of London for centuries. The wall stretched from the Tower of London to Blackfriars, with famous gates including Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate, and Ludgate.</p>

<p>Being within the historic walled city means you're in the very heart of London, where the city began over 2,000 years ago.</p>
